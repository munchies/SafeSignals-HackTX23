  <h2>History~~~~~</h2>
  <p> Morse code is a method of representing letters, numbers, and punctuation with the use of dots, spaces, and dashes. There are various systems, and one was introduced by Samuel F.B. Morse in the 1800s in the United States. The codes were transmitted through signals such as flashing lights. After introducing this system in Europe, there was a realization that the codes weren't adequate for certain symbols. Therefore, a new system called the International Morse Code was created. This was more concise than the original code, making it easier to work with.</p>
